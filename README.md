# HomeAutomationSystem
Automation is the future. It enables us to automate mundane and monotonous applications. Automation has impacted every walk of our life and is considered to be the fourth industrial revolution due to its large number of applications ranging from controlling commonly used household utensils to large industrial devices. Automation starts right at our home. Home automation enables us to access and control any device in our home by simply using our mobile devices. Smart Home appliances are convenient to use as any number of devices can be controlled by just using our smart phones.
The aim of our project is to design an automation system to control the operation of household devices using a NodeMCU board. Many home devices now have WiFi and can interact with other home devices, smartphone applications and home computers. An issue is that these devices cannot communicate with each other or require an additional device to do so and need an individual application on the smartphone to be controlled. A much better option is to unify these devices into one program/device that controls them. It allows them to set up conditions for when the lights turn on. Therefore, home automation can simplify many manual actions.
